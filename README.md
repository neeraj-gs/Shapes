# Shapes
Just a Demo to show the working of git

This repo was forcefully deleted to cehck the merging of pull request when there were no conflicts
There were 2 diffrent bracnhes main and master so no conflicts 

After cloning it is easy to push rather than having it remotely.


This was a Demo Repo where i used to learn and practice basix git and github commands.
